4/22/18, 12:23 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'd be lying if I say I don't
4/22/18, 12:33 AM - Anubhavi: You‚Äôre just drunk
4/22/18, 12:51 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I am drunk
4/22/18, 12:52 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Doesn't that mean I mean what I'm saying
4/22/18, 12:54 AM - Anubhavi: You mean everything
4/22/18, 12:54 AM - Anubhavi: You‚Äôre saying
4/22/18, 12:54 AM - Anubhavi: If you were sober you‚Äôd hesitate a bit.
4/22/18, 1:09 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I only hesitate when I think you'd be uncomfortable.
4/22/18, 1:09 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'm not afraid to say these things.
4/22/18, 1:13 AM - Anubhavi: Really?
4/22/18, 1:17 AM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôm relieved you feel the same way
4/22/18, 1:23 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Of course I feel like that way
4/22/18, 1:24 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I just told you I like you but you don't believe it because you think I'm drunk.
4/22/18, 1:24 AM - Anubhavi: I believe you
4/22/18, 1:24 AM - Anubhavi: I was just testing
4/22/18, 1:26 AM - Anubhavi: Relaxxx
4/22/18, 1:26 AM - Anubhavi: Acha tell me, are you having fun?
4/22/18, 1:29 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: üòí
4/22/18, 1:29 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Oh yeah. Loving it.
4/22/18, 1:30 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: <Media omitted>
4/22/18, 1:32 AM - Anubhavi: You should have taken me with you. ‚òπ
4/22/18, 1:33 AM - Anubhavi: :*
4/22/18, 1:50 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Believe me I wanted to
4/22/18, 1:51 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: If you'd known me longer, and if you felt as comfortable with me as I dream to make you, I wouldn't let you run away.
4/22/18, 1:53 AM - Anubhavi: I never want to run away.
4/22/18, 1:53 AM - Anubhavi: This is special for me
4/22/18, 1:53 AM - Anubhavi: I mean after a long time I‚Äôve felt something like this for someone
4/22/18, 1:56 AM - Anubhavi: You know you always find people who fall for you or like you or need you. And I‚Äôve found people like this in college as well. I‚Äôve fallen for one of them only but he never had the intention of dating me, he just wanted me. He said he felt things but he didn‚Äôt want a relationship basically commitment.
4/22/18, 1:57 AM - Anubhavi: But this time it feels like it‚Äôs equal both ways.
4/22/18, 1:57 AM - Anubhavi: And I really want to share this with you
4/22/18, 1:58 AM - Anubhavi: With Bhullar I had some attachment, he was good to me but he didn‚Äôt have rhe balls to go upto his friends and back me up on things. Hence I broke up with him in 23days.
4/22/18, 1:59 AM - Anubhavi: After that I just had casual hook ups, didn‚Äôt date. Thought of dating but the guy just wanted me physically again. So yeah that ended too.
4/22/18, 2:00 AM - Anubhavi: Casual hook ups happened, then I thought I fell for a friend cus that friend liked me today and I didn‚Äôt know he did. He was smart and he knew how to approach but then the commitment issue came up. Yeah I mentioned him above.
4/22/18, 2:00 AM - Anubhavi: I really fell for him cus we had been friends since my first day in college.
4/22/18, 2:01 AM - Anubhavi: But then we had a lot of fights cus of a lot of things. He felt for me but he just couldn‚Äôt reciprocate what I felt. Again he just wanted me there. Physically.
4/22/18, 2:02 AM - Anubhavi: So ya college life has been pretty messed up.
4/22/18, 2:03 AM - Anubhavi: But out of all these guys nobody had that IQ like the one I need in a guy so that I can talk to him whatever and whenever.
4/22/18, 2:03 AM - Anubhavi: Except the last one I mentioned who couldn‚Äôt commit but felt a lot of things.
4/22/18, 2:04 AM - Anubhavi: That‚Äôs why I thought it‚Äôd work out with him.
4/22/18, 2:05 AM - Anubhavi: But after meeting you, you match that IQ and you‚Äôre good at a lot of things. I like guys who are techie and who understand what is going on around the world.
4/22/18, 2:05 AM - Anubhavi: And lastly with my experience in this college, I needed someone who could speak and write properly in English.
4/22/18, 2:07 AM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôm happy I found you. 
And I feel like I should go on with you because you make me feel confident. Even though we barely have time left but I need to be connected with you all along.
4/22/18, 2:07 AM - Anubhavi: Now you can say something that you feel:)
4/22/18, 2:09 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Wow I'm surprised you feel all those things.
4/22/18, 2:09 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I wanted to say all this but I never knew the right way
4/22/18, 2:10 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You met me at a very strange time in my life
4/22/18, 2:10 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: And I think this time has convinced me to keep you with me all the time.
4/22/18, 2:11 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Believe me when I tell you it's hard to find someone that you completely relate with and completely love.
4/22/18, 2:11 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I am smitten by you and you are smitten by me.
4/22/18, 2:12 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: And I think nothing can be better
4/22/18, 2:13 AM - Anubhavi: What about your friends, half of them hate me cus I left Bhullar.
4/22/18, 2:14 AM - Anubhavi: Although I think with 30 Days left, I shouldn‚Äôt worry but still
4/22/18, 2:15 AM - Anubhavi: I want you to *stick* with me after you leave college. And I promise I will keep seeing you.
4/22/18, 2:17 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Nobody hates you.
4/22/18, 2:17 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: We are not that shallow.
4/22/18, 2:18 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: If you're my girlfriend all my friends would love you more than you think.
4/22/18, 2:18 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You have nothing to be afraid of.
4/22/18, 2:18 AM - Anubhavi: Dude I take names, they still tease me with bhullar‚Äôs name when I pass by.
4/22/18, 2:18 AM - Anubhavi: *can take
4/22/18, 2:18 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: The only person you need to trust is me and you know I'll make everything right
4/22/18, 2:19 AM - Anubhavi: They‚Äôre still not over the fact that me and Bhullar dated.
4/22/18, 2:19 AM - Anubhavi: I know you have a different group of friends.
4/22/18, 2:20 AM - Anubhavi: But the ones related to Bhullar like Nishant khatkar, Rahul Dhatwalia etc etc.
4/22/18, 2:20 AM - Anubhavi: I trust you
4/22/18, 2:22 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Don't worry about that
4/22/18, 2:22 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You can't carry it around with you all the time
4/22/18, 2:22 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Time to let go
4/22/18, 2:22 AM - Anubhavi: You sure?
4/22/18, 2:23 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: No reason to think otherwise
4/22/18, 2:23 AM - Anubhavi: Okay
4/22/18, 2:23 AM - Anubhavi: How drunk is everyone there?
4/22/18, 2:26 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: People have started to die
4/22/18, 2:26 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'm out for a walk
4/22/18, 2:26 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I think I need another drink.
4/22/18, 2:42 AM - Anubhavi: I like your capacity
4/22/18, 2:42 AM - Anubhavi: And I wish to like a lot of things.
4/22/18, 2:43 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Like what
4/22/18, 2:44 AM - Anubhavi: You somewhat close to me
4/22/18, 2:44 AM - Anubhavi: Walk alone?
4/22/18, 2:45 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Don't make me feel so many things at the same time
4/22/18, 2:45 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'll go mad
4/22/18, 2:45 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Yeah
4/22/18, 2:46 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: <Media omitted>
4/22/18, 2:46 AM - Anubhavi: I love bira

4/22/18, 2:50 AM - Anubhavi: Don‚Äôt go nuts also go back home
4/22/18, 2:50 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I think I'm an idiot because I can't express what I feel about you
4/22/18, 2:50 AM - Anubhavi: Why?
4/22/18, 2:50 AM - Anubhavi: I think I‚Äôve told you 70% about how I feel
4/22/18, 2:55 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I've never been so bold
4/22/18, 2:56 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Wish I could tell you

4/22/18, 3:02 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Of course I'm gonna say that you're the greatest thing that's happened to me in a long time
4/22/18, 3:03 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Nobody forces things on me. If I didn't like you I wouldn't have paid attention to you.
4/22/18, 3:04 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: But the fact that I'm so interested in talking to you and seeing you all the time you ought to know I'm serious about you.
4/22/18, 10:48 AM - Anubhavi: I know you‚Äôre serious and you want me close by.

6/17/18, 11:48 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: We're not the kind of couple who talk too often about how serious we are for each other or what we feel. I don't know if that's good or bad

6/17/18, 11:49 PM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôve settled for you
6/17/18, 11:49 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: But you shouldn't start thinking that I don't love you

6/17/18, 11:51 PM - Anubhavi: I know

6/17/18, 11:54 PM - Anubhavi: I know
6/17/18, 11:54 PM - Anubhavi: What if we couldn‚Äôt make it through this year
6/17/18, 11:54 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'm not one for rambling about my love or my feelings and I've always known that this is gonna be my downfall
6/17/18, 11:54 PM - Anubhavi: Although I won‚Äôt let it happen
6/17/18, 11:54 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I don't want that to happen with us.
6/17/18, 11:55 PM - Anubhavi: Yeah me too
6/17/18, 11:55 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Because I'm sure you've had relationships where guys have been more loving and more expressive. I'm sure you miss that.
6/17/18, 11:55 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: And I don't give that to you
6/17/18, 11:55 PM - Anubhavi: No actually it‚Äôs been just one of them

6/17/18, 11:59 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Hmmm that's all I can do when I'm this far
6/17/18, 11:59 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I know you deserve better treatment and knowing that kills me
6/17/18, 11:59 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: What's going to be 6 months
6/18/18, 12:02 AM - Anubhavi: Us
6/18/18, 12:03 AM - Anubhavi: You‚Äôve been so amazing
6/18/18, 12:03 AM - Anubhavi: I couldn‚Äôt have felt better around anyone

6/18/18, 12:14 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Yeah me too

6/18/18, 12:15 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: But I think it's gonna be for you
6/18/18, 12:16 AM - Anubhavi: No

6/18/18, 12:16 AM - Anubhavi: But at college
6/18/18, 12:16 AM - Anubhavi: I guess
6/18/18, 12:18 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Yeah there'll be so many people in college
6/18/18, 12:18 AM - Anubhavi: But not you
6/18/18, 12:18 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You'll be around people all the time
6/18/18, 12:19 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You're not one to roam around in groups
6/18/18, 12:20 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You're gonna be with just one or two guys.
6/18/18, 12:20 AM - Anubhavi: Yeah.
6/18/18, 12:20 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: So there's a possibility that you'll get attached with them, while I'm not there.
6/18/18, 12:24 AM - Anubhavi: I won‚Äôt fall for them
6/18/18, 12:24 AM - Anubhavi: Trust me
6/18/18, 12:24 AM - Anubhavi: You‚Äôre gonna be there all the time in my head
6/18/18, 12:25 AM - Anubhavi: And I‚Äôll be overthinking about us
6/18/18, 12:25 AM - Anubhavi: You
6/18/18, 12:25 AM - Anubhavi: Always
6/18/18, 12:26 AM - Anubhavi: So you don‚Äôt have to worry about that at all
6/18/18, 12:39 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Yeah I don't have a choice, do I?
6/18/18, 12:40 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Of course I'm gonna worry, you can't stop that.
6/18/18, 12:40 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I overthink too, you know. And I'm always gonna keep thinking about other guys in the college who might be keeping you happy.
6/18/18, 12:45 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I hope you're still there. I went to eat something.
6/18/18, 12:46 AM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôm there baby

6/23/18, 5:17 PM - Anubhavi: You say this all the time
6/23/18, 5:17 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I always have a choice between being the clingy over possessive boyfriend and being comfortable with your work life
6/23/18, 5:17 PM - Anubhavi: You told me when your friends ask you about being serious
6/23/18, 5:17 PM - Anubhavi: You get weird

6/23/18, 5:19 PM - Anubhavi: You can share with me
6/23/18, 5:19 PM - Anubhavi: Like I do, all the time about everything
6/23/18, 5:20 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Remember I told you how not telling you how much I love you is ultimately gonna be my downfall
6/23/18, 5:20 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I meant that
6/23/18, 5:21 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I should express myself more. But what you don't know is whenever I open up with you about the smallest things, it's still just you I open up to.
6/23/18, 5:21 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Other people think I'm stone cold. But with you I'm not.
6/23/18, 5:32 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I hope I didn't make you mad

7/5/18, 6:23 PM - Anubhavi: I sleep in some room and phone kahi Aur Hota hai
7/5/18, 6:47 PM - Anubhavi: Aaj lab mei I was discussing you with a colleague and I felt so bad.
7/5/18, 6:47 PM - Anubhavi: Made me feel pathetic.
7/5/18, 6:47 PM - Anubhavi: She told me how can I take you for granted
7/5/18, 6:47 PM - Anubhavi: And I realised I‚Äôve been so mean.
7/5/18, 6:48 PM - Anubhavi: You‚Äôre still there with me
7/5/18, 6:48 PM - Anubhavi: Itni patience
7/5/18, 6:48 PM - Anubhavi: I told her I love him and he knows that and he‚Äôs the most understanding boyfriend one can ever get.
7/5/18, 6:48 PM - Anubhavi: And still I took you for granted
7/5/18, 6:49 PM - Anubhavi: I feel ashamed and pathetic....
7/5/18, 6:52 PM - Anubhavi: That is the time when I msged you at 3:30. I just wanted to drive down to your place and just admit how I‚Äôve been such a bad girlfriend.

7/5/18, 11:41 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'm sure you didn't mean it
7/5/18, 11:53 PM - Anubhavi: I mean everything I said..
7/5/18, 11:54 PM - Anubhavi: And I know that talking won‚Äôt make you happy
7/5/18, 11:55 PM - Anubhavi: I need to meet you to make this happen
7/5/18, 11:55 PM - Anubhavi: Basically in clear words, we need to have sex.
7/5/18, 11:55 PM - Anubhavi: And soon.
7/6/18, 12:05 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Definitely.
7/6/18, 12:05 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Without a doubt.
7/6/18, 12:05 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: It's getting tiresome thinking about you so much and counting the days since we had sex.
7/6/18, 12:06 AM - Anubhavi: Exactly
7/6/18, 12:07 AM - Anubhavi: And I don‚Äôt want either of us to lose hope
7/6/18, 12:07 AM - Anubhavi: Because I can‚Äôt lose you baby
7/6/18, 12:09 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I won't lose hope if you don't
7/6/18, 12:10 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: If you really mean that, it has already put me a little at ease.
7/6/18, 12:10 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I can't even think about the other possibility
7/6/18, 12:11 AM - Anubhavi: I mean it.
7/6/18, 12:11 AM - Anubhavi: I always mean everything to you
7/6/18, 12:11 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Hmmm
7/6/18, 12:11 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I like that
7/6/18, 12:12 AM - Anubhavi: Can you let out more of your anger
7/6/18, 12:12 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Btw you should be the first to know
7/6/18, 12:12 AM - Anubhavi: Tell me
7/6/18, 12:12 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'm starting my training in Mohali from this Monday, most probably.
7/6/18, 12:12 AM - Anubhavi: Are you getting married?
7/6/18, 12:13 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'd jump off a cliff rather than get married now
7/6/18, 12:13 AM - Anubhavi: Wow, that‚Äôs great. Which company?
7/6/18, 12:13 AM - Anubhavi: Also Mohali, you can meet nayanika more often. That‚Äôs good too
7/6/18, 12:14 AM - Anubhavi: ...all of it
7/6/18, 12:14 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Softprodigy
7/6/18, 12:15 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Yeah let's see. I don't think I'll have the time but yeah she'll be close by
7/6/18, 12:15 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: How would I be the understanding boyfriend if I let my anger out on you
7/6/18, 12:23 AM - Anubhavi: I think it‚Äôll help you
7/6/18, 12:26 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I don't know why you want me to be mad
7/6/18, 12:26 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Aren't you glad I'm handling all this well? Because believe me it is tough.
7/6/18, 12:27 AM - Anubhavi: I know and that‚Äôs why
7/6/18, 12:27 AM - Anubhavi: I don‚Äôt want you to keep anything
7/6/18, 12:27 AM - Anubhavi: If you don‚Äôt want too I can‚Äôt force you.
7/6/18, 12:29 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: That's the problem with me. I internalize all these things so I don't trouble your work. Because then you'll start to hate me
7/6/18, 12:29 AM - Anubhavi: I will not hate you baby
7/6/18, 12:29 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Of course I hate it that we hardly talk
7/6/18, 12:29 AM - Anubhavi: Ever
7/6/18, 12:29 AM - Anubhavi: I just don‚Äôt want you to keep things unsettled inside
7/6/18, 12:30 AM - Anubhavi: Just like me you can share everything
7/6/18, 12:30 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Sometimes it feels like we're not even dating. And I feel like shit everytime I think that.
7/6/18, 12:30 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: What's the point of anything if in the end I'm thinking like nothing happened
7/6/18, 12:31 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: It matters how we take this farther. We can keep dating each other for an year but if we talk as much as we do now I feel unwanted.
7/6/18, 12:31 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Which is just pathetic.
7/6/18, 12:32 AM - Anubhavi: So we both feel pathetic.
7/6/18, 12:32 AM - Anubhavi: I feel pathetic Cus of me.
7/6/18, 12:32 AM - Anubhavi: And you feel pathetic Cus of me too
7/6/18, 12:32 AM - Anubhavi: So the problem is me.
7/6/18, 12:32 AM - Anubhavi: I need to talk more.
7/6/18, 12:33 AM - Anubhavi: Can our talks be short if I call in the afternoon or evening whenever I get some time
7/6/18, 12:33 AM - Anubhavi: ?

8/11/18, 11:14 AM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôd want you to go harder and harder
8/11/18, 11:14 AM - Anubhavi: Until I tell you to stop

8/11/18, 11:19 AM - Anubhavi: I just felt like running away
8/11/18, 11:19 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: But I wasn't showing it because it would've ruined your mood. And fucked up the time we did have.

8/17/18, 2:49 PM - Anubhavi: Aditya I don‚Äôt have people in my life
8/17/18, 2:49 PM - Anubhavi: I have you
8/17/18, 2:49 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: If you've make up your mind then I can't say anything. I know you'll go.

8/17/18, 3:36 PM - Anubhavi: I feel like shit
8/17/18, 3:42 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Baby you're over stressed.
8/17/18, 3:43 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You need time off. So yeah do it.
8/17/18, 3:43 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Go wherever you want to. But don't go for the sake of going.
8/17/18, 3:43 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Know what you're hoping for.
8/17/18, 3:45 PM - Anubhavi: I just need some peace in my head.
8/17/18, 3:45 PM - Anubhavi: I need this negativity to go away
8/17/18, 3:45 PM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôm feeling like shit

8/17/18, 3:54 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Why's that babe
There's no reason for that.
8/17/18, 3:55 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: It's the college that sucks the life out of you. Not your fault in any way.
8/17/18, 3:55 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Has Kumud left?
8/17/18, 3:56 PM - Anubhavi: Yes
8/17/18, 4:02 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Aw shucks
8/17/18, 4:02 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Are you in your room?
8/17/18, 4:05 PM - Anubhavi: Where else?
8/17/18, 4:07 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: This is so strange that absolutely nobody is around
8/17/18, 4:07 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Can't you go out to eat with someone? Or drink?
8/17/18, 4:07 PM - Anubhavi: There is no someone
8/17/18, 4:07 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Just to clear your mind a little so you can plan your trip
8/17/18, 4:12 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You can have a drink by yourself. That's a start.
8/17/18, 4:14 PM - Anubhavi: I don‚Äôt want anyone around myself
8/17/18, 4:14 PM - Anubhavi: In the room
8/17/18, 4:14 PM - Anubhavi: There is Rhea
8/17/18, 4:14 PM - Anubhavi: Who acting weirdly
8/17/18, 4:15 PM - Anubhavi: She hasn‚Äôt spoken a word to me today

8/17/18, 4:15 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: It's still daytime
8/17/18, 4:16 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Buy some beers and go sit on that trail we went to.
8/17/18, 4:16 PM - Anubhavi: Sure
8/17/18, 4:16 PM - Anubhavi: It‚Äôs raining
8/17/18, 4:16 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: That's peaceful. Sit there alone for a few hours. Plan your weekend.
8/17/18, 4:16 PM - Anubhavi: The fact that I‚Äôm alone is killing me
8/17/18, 4:17 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: It's a bad day. Not a bad life.
8/17/18, 4:17 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You're not alone
8/17/18, 4:17 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'm not physically present there but it doesn't mean I've left you alone
8/17/18, 4:17 PM - Anubhavi: It‚Äôs not about you
8/17/18, 4:17 PM - Anubhavi: I know you‚Äôre there
8/17/18, 4:18 PM - Anubhavi: I just need someone I can talk to rn
8/17/18, 4:18 PM - Anubhavi: Or you know
8/17/18, 4:18 PM - Anubhavi: Just someone who is there for me
8/17/18, 4:18 PM - Anubhavi: Despite other motives in mind
8/17/18, 4:18 PM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôm scared to share things with people
8/17/18, 4:19 PM - Anubhavi: Because idk who goes on and says things to others
8/17/18, 4:19 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Now I'm in Bangalore. Sometimes I feel alone too.
8/17/18, 4:20 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: But the thought of you being with me keeps me going
8/17/18, 4:20 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'm here.
8/17/18, 4:20 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: If you say you want to talk to me then I'm always here.
8/17/18, 4:20 PM - Anubhavi: You have your flat mates
8/17/18, 4:20 PM - Anubhavi: Office colleagues
8/17/18, 4:20 PM - Anubhavi: You have people
8/17/18, 4:20 PM - Anubhavi: I don‚Äôt!
8/17/18, 4:20 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: The college crowd sucks anyway. Both of us know that.
8/17/18, 4:20 PM - Anubhavi: Yeah
8/17/18, 4:21 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: that's what I tell you.
8/17/18, 4:21 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: That's why I always have time to talk to you. Because you're the most important.
8/17/18, 4:21 PM - Anubhavi: You need atleast one confidante here
8/17/18, 4:21 PM - Anubhavi: I talk to Siddhant
8/17/18, 4:21 PM - Anubhavi: That‚Äôs there I know.
8/17/18, 4:21 PM - Anubhavi: This isn‚Äôt about us aditya
8/17/18, 4:22 PM - Anubhavi: We‚Äôre fine.
8/17/18, 4:22 PM - Anubhavi: It‚Äôs about me and how sick I am of my life
8/17/18, 4:22 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I know.
8/17/18, 4:23 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You're perfect. You just need a change of scenario because college is driving you crazy.
8/17/18, 4:23 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: The worst part is that in college it's almost impossible to find new faces.
8/17/18, 4:23 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Otherwise I would've told you to go out and make friends.
8/17/18, 4:23 PM - Anubhavi: Yeah the group mentality here
8/17/18, 4:24 PM - Anubhavi: Sucks
8/17/18, 4:24 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I feel that way in Jalandhar. So you're gonna have to do what I do.
8/17/18, 4:24 PM - Anubhavi: Individualist personality toh hai hi nahi
8/17/18, 4:24 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Yep yep. Been around that for 18 years.
8/17/18, 4:24 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Listen.
8/17/18, 4:25 PM - Anubhavi: Dude you have friends there who want you
8/17/18, 4:25 PM - Anubhavi: Nobody wants me here
8/17/18, 4:25 PM - Anubhavi: It‚Äôs not the same scenario
8/17/18, 4:25 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Nope. Sucks balls back home.
8/17/18, 4:25 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Baby that's not the problem.
Nobody deserves you there.
8/17/18, 4:26 PM - Anubhavi: You have childhood friends there aditya.
8/17/18, 4:26 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I can count so many people who'd die to be around you. But none of them deserve you.
8/17/18, 4:26 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Honest.
8/17/18, 4:28 PM - Anubhavi: That‚Äôs the thing. It‚Äôs not about quantity. Being chep to someone and you know hanging around in a group. When you eventually don‚Äôt know mean anything to that group
8/17/18, 4:31 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Yeah exactly.
8/17/18, 4:31 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: It's so fucked up
8/17/18, 4:32 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Nobody has anything to say. No new opinions. No interesting people. Just everybody talking about what the other person is doing.
8/17/18, 4:32 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: It's unproductive and lame.
8/17/18, 4:33 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: At times like these I just like to sit alone, listen to good music, watch a mind blowing movie and bitch about everyone I know.
8/17/18, 4:33 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Believe me bitching helps.
8/17/18, 4:33 PM - Anubhavi: Who do I bitch too?
8/17/18, 4:34 PM - Anubhavi: When my own friends bitch about me
8/17/18, 4:35 PM - Anubhavi: I hate how people don‚Äôt have the fucking guts to come up and say something
8/17/18, 4:35 PM - Anubhavi: Being pretentious
8/17/18, 4:35 PM - Anubhavi: I hate that
8/17/18, 4:36 PM - Anubhavi: If I don‚Äôt like someone I give those vibes to that person
8/17/18, 4:37 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Stupid ass place you're stuck in
8/17/18, 4:37 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Nobody else's fault.
8/17/18, 4:38 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: That's the thing. I've always told you're the most independent woman I know.
8/17/18, 4:38 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Because you learnt pretty soon that almost everybody that you run into would be a blithering idiot.
8/17/18, 4:39 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Now you're suffering because of that. And it's okay. Everybody has days like these.
8/17/18, 4:39 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You can't be a badass 24/7
8/17/18, 4:39 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Well you are, most of the time. But still.
8/17/18, 4:40 PM - Anubhavi: I understand what you‚Äôre trying to say
8/17/18, 4:42 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Yeah?
8/17/18, 4:43 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You always knew college was gonna kill you. That's why you drown yourself in work.
8/17/18, 4:43 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Don't think I don't know that.
8/17/18, 4:45 PM - Anubhavi: Yeah
8/17/18, 4:49 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: What are you doing now
8/17/18, 5:10 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Answer üòë

8/24/18, 12:23 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I don't like saying all this because it puts you in a position, but I'm more worried you'll start to think of us as impractical and want to move on.
8/24/18, 12:23 AM - Anubhavi: Acha pehle toh, you can say whatever to me. It‚Äôs best this way, I‚Äôll know what you‚Äôre feeling.

Skim through this series
9/27/18, 9:06 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Do the data types, conditional statements and loops properly.
9/27/18, 9:06 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_cpp_online.php



This is an online compiler to test your code
9/27/18, 9:07 AM - Anubhavi: ^ yeh kya hai
9/27/18, 9:07 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Basic topics Hain. You can't write any piece of code without these three.
9/27/18, 9:07 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: With these, you can use your IQ and just improvise
9/27/18, 9:08 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: But these three are crucial.
9/27/18, 9:08 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Data types are the types of data you can store in variables. Int, char, float etc.
9/27/18, 9:09 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Conditional statements are if else statements
9/27/18, 9:09 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Loops are for loop, while loop
9/27/18, 9:09 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Any basic piece of code can be written using just these three
9/27/18, 9:16 AM - Anubhavi: Send me a link where I can find the function of C and C++
9/27/18, 9:21 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_functions.htm
9/27/18, 9:21 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: It's all in this series
9/27/18, 9:34 AM - Anubhavi: C padhni hai
9/27/18, 9:34 AM - Anubhavi: C++ nahi
9/27/18, 9:34 AM - Anubhavi: Everyone says code in C
9/27/18, 9:36 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You're fucked
9/27/18, 9:36 AM - Anubhavi: Yeah
9/27/18, 9:36 AM - Anubhavi: Like printf and scanf
9/27/18, 9:36 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: But the advantage is that the test will be super basic. 
Always know that C++ is object oriented and C isn't.
9/27/18, 9:36 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You don't need to know that it means
9/27/18, 9:37 AM - Anubhavi: Okay
9/27/18, 9:37 AM - Anubhavi: Acha
9/27/18, 9:37 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/

9/27/18, 9:46 AM - Anubhavi: Thanks
9/27/18, 9:46 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: And if you can manage to sneak your phone in then message me. I'll send you the code
9/27/18, 9:47 AM - Anubhavi: Ya
9/27/18, 9:47 AM - Anubhavi: Def
9/27/18, 9:47 AM - Anubhavi: Def
9/27/18, 9:49 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: :*
9/27/18, 10:05 AM - Anubhavi: Okay so I‚Äôll get an option whether to code in C , C++ , Java and python
9/27/18, 10:05 AM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôll get 50 mins for 2 ques
9/27/18, 10:05 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Python
9/27/18, 10:05 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Python3
9/27/18, 10:05 AM - Anubhavi: I have no idea about python
9/27/18, 10:06 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: If you can sneak your phone in I'll send you everything
9/27/18, 10:06 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: If it's a risk go with what you're comfortable
9/27/18, 10:07 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: If you have time to study then study Python. The syntax is super simple.
9/27/18, 10:07 AM - Anubhavi: Okay
9/27/18, 10:08 AM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôll try to get my phone then
9/27/18, 10:13 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'll be here
9/27/18, 12:04 PM - Anubhavi: Write an algo to determine if s guven string contains balanced sequence of parentheses
9/27/18, 12:05 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: On it
9/27/18, 12:08 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: <Media omitted>
9/27/18, 12:08 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Put your string in input_string
9/27/18, 12:13 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: <Media omitted>
9/27/18, 12:21 PM - Anubhavi: Python hai na
9/27/18, 12:21 PM - Anubhavi: ?
9/27/18, 12:21 PM - Anubhavi: Dono ?
9/27/18, 12:21 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Haan
Python 3
9/27/18, 12:25 PM - Anubhavi: 2.7 hai yaha
9/27/18, 12:25 PM - Anubhavi: Invalid syntax bata raha hai
9/27/18, 12:28 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: This one works in 2.7 too
9/27/18, 12:29 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I've tried
9/27/18, 12:29 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Take care of the indentation
Put the spaces exactly where I've put them
9/27/18, 12:30 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Both the print statements have to be ahead of the other lines
9/27/18, 12:31 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: The spacing should be automatic. If it isn't then use 4 spacebars to create the gap. Or use tab once.
9/27/18, 12:36 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: What is the error
9/27/18, 12:41 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Make sure you use == in the if statement instead of just =
9/27/18, 12:42 PM - Anubhavi: Starting mei kuch likha gai
9/27/18, 12:42 PM - Anubhavi: Hai
9/27/18, 12:42 PM - Anubhavi: Before input string
9/27/18, 12:42 PM - Anubhavi: Syntax error hai
9/27/18, 12:43 PM - Anubhavi: <Media omitted>
9/27/18, 12:43 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Else should be in line with if
9/27/18, 12:43 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: And the print statements should be in line with each other
9/27/18, 12:44 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Tera else is to the right
9/27/18, 12:44 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Indentation error
9/27/18, 12:45 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Wait I'm sending it to you again
9/27/18, 12:45 PM - Anubhavi: 17 mins hai Jaldii
9/27/18, 12:46 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: <Media omitted>
9/27/18, 12:47 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I can't read the the word in front of def. Use that word in place of balance
9/27/18, 12:47 PM - Anubhavi: Its balanced parentheses(str):
9/27/18, 12:48 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: So use balancedParanthesis instead of balance.
9/27/18, 12:48 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: No space. Capital P.
9/27/18, 12:51 PM - Anubhavi: Last line mei balance ?
9/27/18, 12:52 PM - Anubhavi: Or balanceParebthese
9/27/18, 12:52 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: This one
9/27/18, 12:52 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Same word as the one in front of def
9/27/18, 12:53 PM - Anubhavi: Str too?
9/27/18, 12:53 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Remove input_string
Use str everywhere
9/27/18, 12:54 PM - Anubhavi: Last line mei lagau?
9/27/18, 12:54 PM - Anubhavi: Str
9/27/18, 12:54 PM - Anubhavi: Or just balP
9/27/18, 12:54 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: <Media omitted>
9/27/18, 12:54 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Last line mein balancedParantheses('((())))')
9/27/18, 12:54 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: The string that you're checking for
9/27/18, 12:56 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: If the last line gives you an error just remove it. The other part is more important.
9/27/18, 12:57 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Fucking remove the last line. Don't worry about it.
9/27/18, 12:58 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Just write the function properly. Else and if should be aligned. Both the print statements should be aligned.
9/27/18, 12:59 PM - Anubhavi: Input to function consists of a string str containing ‚Äú(‚Äú or‚Äù)‚Äù only
9/27/18, 12:59 PM - Anubhavi: This is the input
9/27/18, 12:59 PM - Anubhavi: Now
9/27/18, 12:59 PM - Anubhavi: Should I put this in the last line
9/27/18, 12:59 PM - Anubhavi: Or?
9/27/18, 1:00 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Look that this photo. You only need the first 5 lines. Exactly as they are. That's it.
9/27/18, 1:00 PM - Anubhavi: Return type mismatch error coming
9/27/18, 1:00 PM - Anubhavi: Integer expected
9/27/18, 1:01 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Use return instead of print
9/27/18, 1:01 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: In both the places. It'll work.
9/27/18, 1:01 PM - Anubhavi: Ok
9/27/18, 1:02 PM - Anubhavi: Same error
9/27/18, 1:02 PM - Anubhavi: Integer expected
9/27/18, 1:02 PM - Anubhavi: But str is returned
9/27/18, 1:02 PM - Anubhavi: 30secs
9/27/18, 1:03 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Return 1
9/27/18, 1:03 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Return 0
9/27/18, 1:03 PM - Anubhavi: Hogaya

9/27/18, 1:04 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Okay
9/27/18, 1:47 PM - Anubhavi: 1 error tha buss will they consider it ?
9/27/18, 1:53 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Don't think so
They were using a test suite
9/27/18, 1:53 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: They only check how many cases your code passed and how many failed
9/27/18, 1:54 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: That's why I'm kinda annoyed this didn't clear
9/27/18, 3:04 PM - Anubhavi: Haan actually
9/27/18, 3:04 PM - Anubhavi: But I think baaki cases clear hojate
9/27/18, 3:28 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Saare cases clear ho jaate
Sirf return 1 and return 0 karna tha
9/27/18, 3:29 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Ye error bohot late pata laga
9/27/18, 3:29 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'm surprised they were giving 50 minutes for this test.
9/27/18, 3:29 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: It shouldn't take more than 3 minutes
9/27/18, 3:36 PM - Anubhavi: There were 2 ques
9/27/18, 3:37 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: What was the other one
9/27/18, 3:37 PM - Anubhavi: Too long
9/27/18, 3:37 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Please tell me if you remember it
9/27/18, 3:37 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I want to know
9/27/18, 3:38 PM - Anubhavi: I didn‚Äôt even read it

10/7/18, 1:04 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: By the way do these guys think you're single? And why didn't Preksha's boyfriend join you? That's kinda weird.

10/8/18, 11:06 PM - Anubhavi: But I need some support
10/8/18, 11:07 PM - Anubhavi: And the only one I have is you
10/8/18, 11:13 PM - Anubhavi: Also you have every reason to be angry with me
10/8/18, 11:14 PM - Anubhavi: But just like consider this the last time I‚Äôm going out with them
10/8/18, 11:14 PM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôll drink alone or whatever with the girls but I‚Äôm not going out with these guys again.
10/8/18, 11:18 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: What happened
10/8/18, 11:18 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Yeah babe.
10/8/18, 11:18 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Of course I don't like what happened

10/8/18, 11:19 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: But I really really can't be fine with something like this. 
I'm sorry if you expect more of me.
10/8/18, 11:21 PM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôm just going to apologise for it.
10/8/18, 11:21 PM - Anubhavi: Because I have no idea how to deal with it either.
10/8/18, 11:21 PM - Anubhavi: Maybe I was wrong partially.
10/8/18, 11:22 PM - Anubhavi: That‚Äôs all I need. You being there with me , that‚Äôs all.
10/8/18, 11:23 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'll be there with you. You know that.
10/8/18, 11:24 PM - Anubhavi: Please don‚Äôt leave me
10/8/18, 11:26 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Of course I won't babe

10/9/18, 12:02 PM - Anubhavi: I know
10/9/18, 12:02 PM - Anubhavi: You‚Äôre completely right
10/9/18, 12:02 PM - Anubhavi: Also I called by mistake at night.
10/9/18, 12:02 PM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôve been crying since like 2 nights
10/9/18, 12:02 PM - Anubhavi: Woke up crying in the morning

10/9/18, 12:30 PM - Anubhavi: Is bothering
10/9/18, 12:33 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Yeah me too
10/9/18, 12:34 PM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôm the one suffering in reality
10/9/18, 12:34 PM - Anubhavi: You‚Äôre just tensed about it
10/9/18, 12:35 PM - Anubhavi: I can‚Äôt fucking leave the room.
10/9/18, 12:37 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Do you think it doesn't bother me?
10/9/18, 12:37 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You're the one who goes out and has fun. I'm the fun sitting here worrying about what might be happening.
10/9/18, 12:37 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: * I'm the one
10/9/18, 12:38 PM - Anubhavi: Dude this doesn‚Äôt happen all the time I go out
10/9/18, 12:39 PM - Anubhavi: Why would I even go out with a group of people who‚Äôre like this
10/9/18, 12:39 PM - Anubhavi: If I had known
10/9/18, 12:39 PM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre not bothered or concerned.
10/9/18, 12:39 PM - Anubhavi: I understand your place
10/9/18, 12:39 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You say you don't even realise when men are touching you and keeping their hands on you
10/9/18, 12:39 PM - Anubhavi: But the actual suffering is what I‚Äôm facing
10/9/18, 12:39 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: What shall I think about that
10/9/18, 12:40 PM - Anubhavi: When have I said this?
10/9/18, 12:40 PM - Anubhavi: I know when it‚Äôs a good touch and when it‚Äôs a bad one.
10/9/18, 12:40 PM - Anubhavi: About this one, I had no idea this was coming.
10/9/18, 12:41 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You said his hand was inside your shirt for just under a minute and you didn't realise it.
10/9/18, 12:41 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Sometimes I think I'm too laid back
10/9/18, 12:42 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: There have been so many situations that I've been cool about. 
If you had found me in any of those situations you'd kill me.
10/9/18, 12:43 PM - Anubhavi: I didn‚Äôt know in that moment but like after 30secs , after I poured the drink I realised
10/9/18, 12:43 PM - Anubhavi: Then I moved away
10/9/18, 12:43 PM - Anubhavi: What more could I do
10/9/18, 12:43 PM - Anubhavi: As soon as I knew I moved
10/9/18, 12:44 PM - Anubhavi: Every situation is intentional or unintentional from both sides. There is an explanation for everything only if you try to understand.
10/9/18, 12:45 PM - Anubhavi: You can‚Äôt just assume things in situations like these
10/9/18, 12:45 PM - Anubhavi: If it was intentional from my side I wouldn‚Äôt have even told you about it
10/9/18, 12:47 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I've got no choice but to say okay
10/9/18, 12:47 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I won't get mad at you because I trust you
10/9/18, 12:47 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I trust that it wasn't intentional from your side.
10/9/18, 12:48 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I have to. Because we hardly talk.
10/9/18, 12:48 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You have to understand my situation. How tough it is for me to find out the kind of things you get into.
10/9/18, 1:00 PM - Anubhavi: We don‚Äôt call much , but like in every 2 days we do talk. And we‚Äôre texting everyday
10/9/18, 1:00 PM - Anubhavi: I understand
10/9/18, 1:10 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'm not talking about small talk. Or catching up. 
It's hard to explain.
10/9/18, 1:10 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I don't think so. If you did you'd know how much I hate being in this situation.
10/9/18, 1:11 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: When something like this happens, should I be the pestering boyfriend who you'll eventually stop loving? Or should I be the idiot who lets his girlfriend run wild.
10/9/18, 1:11 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You tell me. How should I handle it?
10/9/18, 1:14 PM - Anubhavi: I can‚Äôt tell you what to do
10/9/18, 1:14 PM - Anubhavi: I can tell you how I feel
10/9/18, 1:17 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Hmmm yeah
10/9/18, 1:20 PM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôll call you at 7
10/9/18, 1:21 PM - Anubhavi: I can‚Äôt talk right now because I‚Äôm feeling really low and it‚Äôs pathetic
10/9/18, 1:22 PM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôm crying
10/9/18, 1:22 PM - Anubhavi: And if I talk while crying I‚Äôll probably die.
10/9/18, 1:22 PM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôm switching off my phone.
10/9/18, 1:22 PM - Anubhavi: Speak to you at 7.  
Bye
10/9/18, 1:23 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Don't do that babe
10/9/18, 1:23 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You can't get through anything without talking to each other
10/9/18, 1:24 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: That's why I invest so much time in you.
10/9/18, 1:24 PM - Anubhavi: Please don‚Äôt I‚Äôm not worth it
10/9/18, 1:24 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: We will not be able to survive anything if we don't communicate with each other
10/9/18, 1:24 PM - Anubhavi: I can‚Äôt even idk..
10/9/18, 1:24 PM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôm really sorry

10/9/18, 1:26 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: We'll figure it out
10/9/18, 1:26 PM - Anubhavi: Yeah I‚Äôm just sensitive
10/9/18, 1:27 PM - Anubhavi: About the people who matter
10/9/18, 1:27 PM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôm sorry you have to deal with this
10/9/18, 1:28 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'll deal with everything you throw at me.
10/9/18, 1:29 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Because I want to keep you
10/9/18, 1:29 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: As long we're transparent
10/9/18, 8:47 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Aren't you free yet

10/20/18, 11:11 AM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôm not running anywhere aditya
10/20/18, 11:12 AM - Anubhavi: I need time to cope up and you know that
10/20/18, 1:54 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You're getting colder by the day
10/20/18, 1:55 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Take whatever time you need, but let me know when you're doing that.
10/20/18, 1:55 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: So I don't waste my time thinking there's something wrong
10/20/18, 2:27 PM - Anubhavi: Again
10/20/18, 3:38 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I know
10/20/18, 3:52 PM - Anubhavi: Chill scenes ....
10/20/18, 3:52 PM - Anubhavi: Kuch hoga toh I‚Äôll def tell you
10/20/18, 3:52 PM - Anubhavi: Why would I hide from the only person I talk to about everything
10/20/18, 4:50 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Yeah babe I know
10/20/18, 11:27 PM - Anubhavi: I love you

10/20/18, 11:35 PM - Anubhavi: <Media omitted>
10/21/18, 1:00 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You're always cold with me. I'm trying to not get used to it.
10/21/18, 1:00 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: But I don't know
I still love you
10/21/18, 1:00 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Goodnight
10/21/18, 9:45 AM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôm not always cold. It‚Äôs the circumstances.
10/21/18, 9:47 AM - Anubhavi: Just like how you‚Äôre mean to me.
10/21/18, 9:47 AM - Anubhavi: Always
10/21/18, 9:48 AM - Anubhavi: And I‚Äôve adapted myself to that behaviour of yours
10/21/18, 9:48 AM - Anubhavi: You think I‚Äôm cold
10/21/18, 9:48 AM - Anubhavi: I mean it‚Äôs okay
10/21/18, 9:48 AM - Anubhavi: If you feel so I can‚Äôt really say anything more ...
10/21/18, 9:49 AM - Anubhavi: Whatever you feel I‚Äôm okay with it.
10/21/18, 9:49 AM - Anubhavi: Can‚Äôt change so nvm
10/21/18, 10:32 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: That was a joke. I'm not mean to you. I don't recall doing anything to make you complain.
10/21/18, 10:40 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'm always available for you. All the time.
10/21/18, 10:40 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I never turn my back on you and I always show you all my love, upfront.
10/21/18, 10:41 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: If there was something you didn't like you clearly didn't even tell me about it
10/21/18, 11:38 AM - Anubhavi: See you have been mean a lot of times
10/21/18, 11:39 AM - Anubhavi: During your birthday
10/21/18, 11:39 AM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôve told you before
10/21/18, 11:40 AM - Anubhavi: When have I turned my back on you ?
10/21/18, 11:40 AM - Anubhavi: You‚Äôre available I know
10/21/18, 11:41 AM - Anubhavi: But I‚Äôve not told to be so focused on me that you have to schedule your things accordingly
10/21/18, 11:41 AM - Anubhavi: I mean that‚Äôs not how I want it to be
10/21/18, 11:41 AM - Anubhavi: Also there is a clear fact that you are mean and cold because when I don‚Äôt give you attention you just move away.
10/21/18, 11:42 AM - Anubhavi: You‚Äôve done it before as well and you‚Äôve told me as well
10/21/18, 11:42 AM - Anubhavi: If you don‚Äôt get an answer to something you drop it
10/21/18, 11:43 AM - Anubhavi: Isn‚Äôt that mean and cold...
10/21/18, 11:43 AM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôm just stating facts that‚Äôs all
10/21/18, 11:43 AM - Anubhavi: It‚Äôs not like I want to blame you
10/21/18, 11:43 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I know. I don't do that. Atleast not anymore.
10/21/18, 11:44 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Don't call it giving attention. It's called basic communication.
10/21/18, 11:44 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I think we have a lot of catching up to do
10/21/18, 11:45 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: There are misunderstandings and issues floating everywhere
10/21/18, 11:45 AM - Anubhavi: Whenever I need some days off you say that we need catching up
10/21/18, 11:45 AM - Anubhavi: It‚Äôs not like that
10/21/18, 11:45 AM - Anubhavi: Why can‚Äôt it be normal
10/21/18, 11:45 AM - Anubhavi: When you called the other day was I mean?
10/21/18, 11:45 AM - Anubhavi: I clearly told you I‚Äôve been going through some issues
10/21/18, 11:46 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Wow.
10/21/18, 11:46 AM - Anubhavi: It‚Äôs all about the circumstances
10/21/18, 11:46 AM - Anubhavi: Isn‚Äôt it true?
10/21/18, 11:47 AM - Anubhavi: If I need some space from everything I‚Äôve been going through it isn‚Äôt necessary that I‚Äôll tell you about it.
10/21/18, 11:47 AM - Anubhavi: It‚Äôs a personal thinking process
10/21/18, 11:47 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'm thinking you've misunderstood everything I've ever told you
10/21/18, 11:47 AM - Anubhavi: Nobody shares such things with people around.
10/21/18, 11:48 AM - Anubhavi: No
10/21/18, 11:49 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Haven't we done that before? We've told each other when we need some introspection time so one of us is gonna take some time off.
10/21/18, 11:49 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: But that's not even the point
10/21/18, 11:49 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: That's way behind us
10/21/18, 11:50 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'm not gonna explain the issue again and again to you. I've been doing it every 20 days since I don't even remember when.
10/21/18, 11:50 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I thought you'd have understood by now
10/21/18, 11:53 AM - Anubhavi: There is no issue.
10/21/18, 11:53 AM - Anubhavi: Firstly
10/21/18, 11:54 AM - Anubhavi: I had my own issues and you just weren‚Äôt aware so you thought I‚Äôm ignoring.
10/21/18, 11:54 AM - Anubhavi: There is clearly no issue from my side.
10/21/18, 11:54 AM - Anubhavi: If you still have allegations about being cold and shiz I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôll have to deal with it momentarily.
10/21/18, 11:55 AM - Anubhavi: Cus even I am.
10/21/18, 11:55 AM - Anubhavi: Is there anything else?
10/21/18, 11:56 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'm not even talking about the 3 days you went missing. You told me you need the time so that's the end of it.
10/21/18, 11:56 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You can take 10 days away if you think you need the time
10/21/18, 11:57 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I don't have any issues with that
10/21/18, 11:57 AM - Anubhavi: What is making you crazy then
10/21/18, 11:57 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Ahhhh
10/21/18, 11:58 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Not now anyway
10/21/18, 11:58 AM - Anubhavi: Tell me
10/21/18, 11:58 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You've got to deal with things. And you've got exams coming up.
10/21/18, 11:58 AM - Anubhavi: So that I don‚Äôt have to drink today thinking about all the BT
10/21/18, 11:58 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'll wait another 10 days. That's nothing for us.
10/21/18, 11:58 AM - Anubhavi: Oh fuck exams
10/21/18, 11:58 AM - Anubhavi: I haven‚Äôt studied
10/21/18, 11:59 AM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Why not? Enjoying Moksh too much?
10/21/18, 11:59 AM - Anubhavi: If you want to tell me then now is the time
10/21/18, 11:59 AM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôve been drinking a lot lately don‚Äôt have the time and energy for it.
10/21/18, 11:59 AM - Anubhavi: ..
10/21/18, 12:00 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I know you have
10/21/18, 12:00 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Fuck
10/21/18, 12:00 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'm not typing it out
10/21/18, 12:00 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Later
10/21/18, 12:00 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Sorry
10/21/18, 12:00 PM - Anubhavi: Call me
10/21/18, 12:00 PM - Anubhavi: Then
10/21/18, 12:01 PM - Anubhavi: Or you have other things to handle rn ?
10/21/18, 12:02 PM - Anubhavi: This is mean. You hanging up on me ..
10/21/18, 12:05 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: It's not mean
10/21/18, 12:05 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'm rearranging my thoughts
10/21/18, 12:06 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Because I don't wanna lash out
10/21/18, 12:06 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: First of all, please understand this.
10/21/18, 12:08 PM - Anubhavi: Ok
10/21/18, 12:08 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I'm trying to compose a sentence. Wait.
10/21/18, 12:08 PM - Anubhavi: Ok
10/21/18, 12:12 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: If one of us raises some concerns about the things they don't like, and the other person gets annoyed and says why are you going crazy over nothing, it means we're not in a healthy relationship.
10/21/18, 12:13 PM - Anubhavi: Dude okay wow this is just I mean I can‚Äôt even process this
10/21/18, 12:14 PM - Anubhavi: It‚Äôs called understanding dude. We‚Äôre both negotiating our terms for this relationship.
10/21/18, 12:14 PM - Anubhavi: Why are you thinking about it in such a different dimension
10/21/18, 12:15 PM - Anubhavi: I mean I don‚Äôt know what the fuck is bothering you sm that you‚Äôve thought about our relationship in such a way.
10/21/18, 12:16 PM - Anubhavi: I would never do this.
10/21/18, 12:16 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: There's an if at the beginning of this sentence
10/21/18, 12:17 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Again
If something is happening that I don't like, should I suck it up like I always do or should I voice it at the risk of making you angry like you are now
10/21/18, 12:28 PM - Anubhavi: I understand what you were trying to say indirectly. So it doesn‚Äôt matter if there is an IF.
10/21/18, 12:29 PM - Anubhavi: That‚Äôs upto you. I suck it up too and sometimes I say it on your face.
10/21/18, 12:30 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: There was nothing indirect in this
10/21/18, 12:30 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: The if is there for a reason
10/21/18, 12:30 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You kinda make my point for me. Sucking up is a bad move. Never do it.
10/21/18, 12:31 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Because this
10/21/18, 1:06 PM - Anubhavi: Okay
10/21/18, 1:06 PM - Anubhavi: So lash it out on me then
10/21/18, 1:20 PM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôm all ears
10/21/18, 1:45 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: That won't help anyone
10/21/18, 1:45 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: We'll discuss it later
10/21/18, 1:45 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Happy 6 months
10/21/18, 2:41 PM - Anubhavi: Chalo okay whatever you feel

10/21/18, 8:33 PM - Anubhavi: I hope you‚Äôre okay?

10/28/18, 5:09 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You didn't have to do that because you were out with your friends and they already think of me as a spoilsport. But that was sweet.
10/28/18, 5:09 PM - Anubhavi: Really ? You just said we barely talk ...
10/28/18, 5:09 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I trust you. I also told you I don't do these things on text.
10/28/18, 5:10 PM - Anubhavi: I called you because I was buzzed and I wanted to talk to my boyfriend and I didn‚Äôt fucking mention that I was safe and etc , that was Preksha. I just wanted to talk ...
10/28/18, 5:10 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You're not used to talking on the phone and I'm not used to texting. But that's okay. It's always been like that with us
10/28/18, 5:11 PM - Anubhavi: Dude it‚Äôs not about being a spoilsport. I needed talk so I did. And you‚Äôre my boyfriend I understand your concern
10/28/18, 5:11 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: We've always been like that. And I mean talk, not text. They're different things.
10/28/18, 5:11 PM - Anubhavi: Yes but communication is the key right
10/28/18, 5:12 PM - Anubhavi: We can‚Äôt call each other every hour to talk or share what you just did rn
10/28/18, 5:12 PM - Anubhavi: Hence we text and that‚Äôs how it works
10/28/18, 5:13 PM - Anubhavi: Talking at night is chill I get it. My exams got over yesterday I had the fucking time during the party to call you up. I was waiting when I‚Äôd get free from exams and call you
10/28/18, 5:13 PM - Anubhavi: And I did it yesterday
10/28/18, 5:13 PM - Anubhavi: It‚Äôs been one day after the exams and I called you just how you like it to be.
10/28/18, 5:14 PM - Anubhavi: I‚Äôll call you now eventually..

10/28/18, 5:15 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I don't know why you think I get awkward
10/28/18, 5:15 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Even if I do, it's totally my problem. Because you're not doing anything wrong.
10/28/18, 5:15 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: So I try to handle it myself
10/28/18, 5:16 PM - Anubhavi: Even I don‚Äôt know yaar
10/28/18, 5:17 PM - Anubhavi: What‚Äôs the point in handling it yourself when we can‚Äôt be okay ..
10/28/18, 5:19 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: What do you mean "we can't be okay"
10/28/18, 5:20 PM - Anubhavi: Abe this thing happening between us is because of the ambiguity that is there
10/28/18, 5:21 PM - Anubhavi: You can‚Äôt express yourself what you‚Äôre going through
10/28/18, 5:22 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I get what you mean
10/28/18, 5:22 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Whenever I get distressed, it's either something you did or something my own damn mind made up.
10/28/18, 5:23 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: If it's your thing, I tell you about it, always.
10/28/18, 5:23 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: But when it's my own mind then it's my own responsibility to handle it. You can't do anything about that. No one can.
10/28/18, 5:23 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I think this is when I might get weird.
10/28/18, 6:03 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Yo what happened to you
10/28/18, 6:13 PM - Anubhavi: So you can‚Äôt share what you‚Äôre thinking basically?
10/28/18, 6:19 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: We've talked about this before.
10/28/18, 6:19 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Both of us have some things in our minds that we don't tell the other person. It's normal.
10/28/18, 6:20 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: It doesn't mean we don't share with each other.
10/28/18, 6:20 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: You do it too
10/28/18, 6:21 PM - Anubhavi: Aree but I don‚Äôt mention things like ‚Äòyou won‚Äôt understand what I went through last time‚Äô
10/28/18, 6:21 PM - Anubhavi: Because I‚Äôve said everything and i left on you for to understand.
10/28/18, 6:23 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: So did I
10/28/18, 6:23 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: We talked a lot that night. I told you everything.
10/28/18, 6:25 PM - Anubhavi: Then why are you telling me that I won‚Äôt understand???
10/28/18, 6:25 PM - Anubhavi: See When you haven‚Äôt told me what you‚Äôre through you don‚Äôt have to the right to say I won‚Äôt understand
10/28/18, 6:25 PM - Anubhavi: Or either tell me that you‚Äôve told me about it and then I didn‚Äôt get it.
10/28/18, 6:25 PM - Anubhavi: And remind me what I don‚Äôt understand. I
10/28/18, 6:27 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I dumped a huge load of information on you that time. That's more than enough to sort.
10/28/18, 6:28 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: Obviously I can't know how much you caught on to. But I told you everything.
10/28/18, 6:29 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I always tell you. I don't text these things but whenever we get time I always tell you. 
That's why calls with me might feel heavy.
10/28/18, 6:29 PM - Aditya Vikram Monga: I drop some load off everytime
10/28/18, 6:30 PM - Anubhavi: Okay
10/28/18, 6:31 PM - Anubhavi: So then don‚Äôt talk to me saying you won‚Äôt get it , chod rehne de.
